			<h1>GEN.PARVEZ MUSHARRAF</h1>
				<p>Keeping the news from my mother was impossible, of course. She soon discovered what had happened as concerned colleagues, rela- tives, and friends started calling or dropping in. The story was all over television and on the front pages of newspapers the next day. I had over- shadowed both Saddam and polo, at least in Pakistan</p>

				<p>That evening Sehba and I were to attend a wedding at the Serena Hotel in Islamabad. We did not hesitate. Both of us went. Our decision caused no little consternation among the guests, as they thought that I had good reason to remain in the safety of my house only a few hours after terrorists had tried to assassinate me. I am sure that my escape, and my not breaking my schedule, must have caused disappointment and dismay among the terrorists. Sticking to the schedule may have caused some concern among my security personnel, but they are trained to take such things in stride. It certainly did cause some inconvenience to motorists, as the traffic along the route was blocked.</p>
				<p> Before the assassination attempt, I would flow with the normal traf- fic, stopping at every red light. Now things started changing. The police started blocking all traffic in either direction along the route that I was to take. There were new escort vehicles on either side of my car. And, of course, my exact schedule would not be known to anyone except those closest to me.</p>

			<h1>Microprocessors</h1>
				<p>Most computers today are digital.  They represent information discretely and use a binary 
      (two-step) system that represents each piece of information as a series of zeroes and ones.  
           T      he Pocket Webster School &  Office Dictionary (1990) simply defines Digital computers as 
        “a computer using numbers in calculating.”  Digital computers manipulate most data more 
             easily than analog computers.  They are designed to process data in numerical form and their 
         circuits perform directly the mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
           and division.  Because digital information is discrete, it can be copied exactly but it is 
          difficult to make exact copies of analog information.  </p>

			<p>The computer evolution is indeed an interesting topic that has been explained in some 
        different ways over the years, by many authors.  According to The Computational Science 
              Education Project, US, the computer has evolved through the following stages: </p>
